# Anti-AFK
Tired of that pesky AFK timer? This is for you! <br />
Anti-AFK is a lightweight [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script to deal with AFK timers! <br />
You can use your computer as normal, without any interruptions while Anti-AFK is running!

## Installation:
Download [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and run Anti-AFK.ahk <br />
This is designed for [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/) but you can change the process it looks for if you want to use it on a different game!

## Suggestions and Bugs
Open an issue and I'll see what I can do!

## Is it Bannable?
### Short Answer:
Very Unlikley

### Long answer:
Anti-AFK works by sending keystrokes to reset any potential AFK timers. While these are theoretically undetectable AutoHotkey makes no attempt to hide itself so **don't use this is macros are blacklisted!** <br />
The game's window also becomes temporarily transparent if the game is in the background. I highly doubt any game would check for this, let alone ban - but the more you know, I guess...

## Q&A:
### Can I run it while I play Roblox?
Yes, it will automatically enable and disable itself when needed!

### So it can be kept running 24/7?
Yes!

### Can I make it start up automatically then?
Yup! Just put it in the [Startup Folder](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-app-to-run-automatically-at-startup-in-windows-10-150da165-dcd9-7230-517b-cf3c295d89dd)!

### Antivirus?
There should not be any issues, in the case there there are just allow it - you can read the source code <br />
I'm only including this so that one guy can't randomly yell "VIRUS!!!"
