# Anti-AFK
A lightweight AutoHotkey script to deal with AFK timers.<br>
Supports unfocused windows in addition to multiple processes!<br>

## Installation
Simply install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and run [Anti-AFK](Anti-AFK.ahk), a config is included in the script.<br>

## How does it work?
Anti-AFK works by sending keystrokes to reset any potential AFK timers.<br>

Should the window be in the background, it will be temporarily be made transparent when brought to the front in order to make the script less invasive.<br>

## Is it bannable?
This heavily depends on the program you intend to use it on. With that in mind, AutoHotkey makes no attempt to hide itself so be careful if macros are blacklisted!<br>
